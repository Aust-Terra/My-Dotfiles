# My-Dotfiles

Just some of my dotfiles for arch. I'll add screenshots later. Some of the stuff will be referencing locations on the disk, eg most things relating to fonts / images, so change them to suit your liking.
# Dependencies
I'll do my best to list all dependencies, but open up an issue or just figure it out. In heindsight, there are a lot of dependencies that I don't know. Idk this isn't meant to be a cut and go solution, just look at the dotfiles and take what you want.
